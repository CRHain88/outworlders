 # Homepage template
 # ---------------
 #
 # When this template gets loaded, it will be because someone has accessed
 # http://dryfloodproofing.com/ (without any URI). Craft checks to see if you
 # have a Single section set to be the Homepage (as you do, by default), and
 # loads the section’s Template (this file). A special ‘entry’ variable
 # will already be set for you, assigned to the Homepage entry.
 #
 # It's worth noting that even if you didn't have a Homepage Single section,
 # as long as this template remains at public/templates/index.html, it
 # would still be the one to get loaded when accessing
 # http://dryfloodproofing.com/, albeit without an ‘entry’ variable already set
 # for you.

                </div>
                <p>OutWorlders, Inc. is a science fiction, fantasy and horror fan group that supports and promotes gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender themes within these genres. Everyone is welcome. An interest in the genres and an open mind are the only requirements. Our members are as diverse as their interests and enjoy exploring fandom in a welcoming community of like-minded people.</p>
                <p>If you enjoy watching movies, reading books, playing games, want to learn more about the GLBT content that is out there in the SF/F/H world, or just want to hang out with people with similar interests, you should come out to one of our many events. We keep our event calendar very full, so there's bound to be something that will catch your interest. And if not...suggest it! To get more involved in the planning, structuring and future of the group, consider becoming a sponsoring member!</p>

                <h1>Become a Member</h1>
                <p>To become a member of OutWorlders, you need simply attend an OutWorlders event. You read correctly: We're that easy. However, we do require that you enjoy yourself as you participate, and no one is exempt from this requirement. As a member, you are welcome to advertise your genre-related events through the <a href="mailto:events@outworlders.info">events coordinator</a>. Our organization is a growing network of people with a wide variety of interests, and we encourage members to use the group to contact others with similar interests to get together for video nights, movie outings, local attractions or events, and the like.</p>
                <p>To become a sponsoring member of OutWorlders, you must be a member and be willing to pay our modest annual dues of $10. (Contact the Treasurer to find out how.) In addition to gaining the great respect of your peers, as a sponsoring member you are eligible to serve in an officer position in OutWorlders, are able to host official OutWorlders events, and are eligible to vote on proposals at the OutWorlders business meetings. Moreover, you will also be invited to join the sponsoring members mailing list, and who wouldn't want to be on yet another mailing list?!</p>
